# NewYork_City_Bikes
In order to optimize operations for City Bikes equipment and locations, three months of data were compared to track and trend one quarter's patterns and habits. 

Data was obtained from https://citibikenyc.com/system-data. Individual month's data were aggregated using Pandas in order to build one csv to be visualized using tableau. The Tabeau story may be viewed at the following link

The total number of rides recorded over a three month period in 2023 (September, October, and November) were      267,463 as calcualted by row_count=len(df23) in the Jupyter notebook. 

Overall ridership increased from September to October by 3.6% and then decreased by 22% from October to November.

67% of all riders captured during the period captured by the data were membership holders.
